# Data Structures

Data Structures is a series of packages written in Java and C++ for organizing 
data structures as abstract classes and their implemented subclasses.

## Installation

Import the packages in (abstract_classes). From there, you can modify and 
implement any data structure as needed quickly for backend development projects. 


## Usage

Import the desired abstract class and concrete subclass of the data structure 
needed. Then, modify the structure to implement the program as desired in 
your own program.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

This code is inspired by concepts from CS3134 but does not complete any 
assignment structure on its own to this course.
